## Bash Magic

Write a **BASH script** that takes the CSV file from Problem 1 (`teams.csv`) as input and outputs a summary of the information in another CSV file.

The output CSV will have the name `summary.csv` and will contain the number of teams from each country in the following format:

```
country,teams
Romania,1
...
```

Feel free to use a dummy file as input if you have not (yet) solved Problem 1.
