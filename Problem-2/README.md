## Bash Magic
Write a bash script that takes the csv file from problem 1, `teams.csv`, and makes a summary of the information in another csv file named `summary.csv`

The second csv will have the name `summary.csv` and will contain the number of teams from each country and it will have the following format:
`country,number of teams`
Ex:
```
Romania,1
```
